# Programming IoT Smart Pot with ESP32 and WiFi Connectivity March 2024

Welcome to the repository for the IoT Smart Pot project! This project focuses on developing a WiFi-enabled Smart Pot IoT Device using the ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors. With Blynk app integration, users can monitor plant health remotely and visualize real-time data effortlessly. The project utilizes the WiFiManager library for seamless WiFi configuration and multi-user collaboration.

Hardware Used:

-Three Analog soil moisture sensors

-Light-dependent resistor (LDR) for light measurement

-ESP32 DevKit as the microcontroller

-Push button for WiFi configuration

The Smart Pot sends notifications to the user when the soil moisture level is low, indicating that the plant needs watering. This project serves as the initial step, with plans for future development including the creation of a dedicated mobile app for enhanced user experience.
